Date: 2025-01-15
Purpose: Track all modifications, additions, and improvements to the project

================================================================================

CHANGE #1: Fixed Model Compatibility Issue
Date: 2025-01-15
Files Modified: Created retrain_model.py
Problem: The original final_model.sav was trained with scikit-learn 0.18.1,
         but the current environment has scikit-learn 1.7.2 installed.
         This caused ModuleNotFoundError when trying to load the model.

Solution: Created retrain_model.py to retrain the model with the current version

File: retrain_model.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What it does:
1. Loads the training data from train.csv
2. Handles missing values by filling them with empty spaces
3. Creates a machine learning pipeline with two components:

   a) TfidfVectorizer (Feature Extraction):
      - Converts text into numerical features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
      - Parameters:
        * stop_words='english': Removes common English words like "the", "is", "at"
        * ngram_range=(1,5): Captures word patterns from single words up to 5-word phrases
        * use_idf=True: Weighs words by how unique they are across documents
        * smooth_idf=False: Uses standard IDF calculation without smoothing

   b) LogisticRegression (Classifier):
      - The actual machine learning algorithm that makes predictions
      - Parameters:
        * penalty="l2": Uses L2 regularization to prevent overfitting
        * C=1: Regularization strength (default value)
        * max_iter=1000: Maximum training iterations

4. Trains the model on all training data (Statement column as input, Label as output)
5. Saves the trained model to final_model.sav using pickle serialization

Why these parameters?
- These are the best-performing parameters found in classifier.py (lines 171-174)
- Logistic Regression with n-grams achieved ~70% F1-score in testing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHANGE #2: Updated requirements.txt
Date: 2025-01-15
Files Modified: requirements.txt
Added Dependencies:
- requests>=2.28.0 (for future API integration)
- python-dotenv>=1.0.0 (for environment variable management)

What these do:
- requests: Python library for making HTTP requests to APIs
- python-dotenv: Loads environment variables from .env files (keeps API keys secure)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHANGE #3: Created Test Scripts
Date: 2025-01-15
Files Created: test_prediction.py

File: test_prediction.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What it does:
1. Loads the retrained model from final_model.sav
2. Tests the model with 3 different statements:
   - "Mexico will pay for the wall"
   - "The president announced new economic policies today"
   - "Scientists discover cure for cancer"

3. For each statement:
   - Makes a prediction (True or False)
   - Calculates the probability/confidence score
   - Displays the results in a readable format

Why this is useful:
- Verifies the model works correctly after retraining
- Allows non-interactive testing (doesn't require user input)
- Shows example predictions with confidence scores

Output format:
Statement: [the test statement]
Prediction: [True or False]
Probability: [percentage confidence]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UPCOMING CHANGES (Not Yet Implemented)
================================================================================

PLANNED: Google Fact Check API Integration
Purpose: Enhance accuracy by cross-referencing claims with professional fact-checkers
Status: Plan documented in GOOGLE_FACTCHECK_API_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
Expected Impact: 15-25% accuracy improvement for previously fact-checked claims

Files to be created:
1. factcheck_api.py - API client for Google Fact Check Tools
2. prediction_enhanced.py - Hybrid prediction system (API + ML model)
3. factcheck_cache.py - Caching system to reduce API calls
4. test_factcheck_api.py - Test suite for API integration
5. .env - Secure storage for API key (not committed to git)

How it will work:
1. User enters a claim
2. System checks Google Fact Check API for existing fact-checks
3. If found: Uses professional fact-checker verdict (high confidence)
4. If not found: Falls back to ML model prediction
5. Displays both sources and confidence scores

Benefits:
- Near 100% accuracy for claims that have been fact-checked
- Professional citations (PolitiFact, Snopes, FactCheck.org, etc.)
- Transparent source attribution
- Free to use (Google provides API at no cost)

================================================================================
TECHNICAL NOTES
================================================================================

Current ML Model Details:
- Algorithm: Logistic Regression with TF-IDF features
- Feature Extraction: Unigrams through 5-grams (1-5 word combinations)
- Training Data: LIAR dataset (~10,000 political statements)
- F1 Score: ~0.70 (70% balanced accuracy)
- Strengths: Good at detecting patterns in political claims
- Weaknesses: Lower confidence on new/unique statements

Model Architecture (Pipeline):
Input Statement
    ↓
TfidfVectorizer (converts text to numbers)
    ↓
LogisticRegression (makes True/False prediction)
    ↓
Output: Prediction + Probability

Why Logistic Regression?
- Fast prediction speed
- Interpretable (can see which words influence predictions)
- Works well with text features
- Good balance of accuracy and simplicity

Alternative models tested (in classifier.py):
1. Naive Bayes - F1: 0.67
2. Linear SVM - F1: 0.68
3. SGD Classifier - F1: 0.64
4. Random Forest - F1: 0.67

Logistic Regression with n-grams performed best overall.

================================================================================
USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

To retrain the model (if needed):
1. Open terminal in project directory
2. Run: python retrain_model.py
3. Wait for "Model retrained and saved successfully!" message
4. The new final_model.sav will be ready to use

To test the model:
1. Run: python test_prediction.py
2. Review the predictions for the 3 test statements
3. Verify confidence scores are reasonable (>50%)

To use the interactive prediction:
1. Run: python prediction.py
2. Enter a news statement when prompted
3. Get prediction and probability score
4. Type a new statement or close the program

Common Issues:
- ModuleNotFoundError: Run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
- Model not found: Run retrain_model.py to create final_model.sav
- Low confidence predictions: Normal for ambiguous statements
